# Configuration Support for Python Packages and CLIs

This package provides a way to define command-line-interface (CLI) applications
such that user options can be stored in Python-based configuration files and
read-out automatically.  It also provides a rather simple RC (global
configuration) file support that can be used by modules to read
application-wide default values.

For installation and usage instructions, check-out our documentation.
